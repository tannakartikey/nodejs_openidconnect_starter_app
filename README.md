# NodeJS + Express OpenID Connect with Deauthorized server

- This is a sample NodeJS app that uses OpenID Connect with the Deauthorized identity server.
- This app also serves as a basic blueprint for intergation with your apps for development.  

## Create a Deauthorized Application

1. Sign up for the Deauthorized Private Beta
2. Log into Deauthorized Dashboard
3. Create a new application from the Create Applications tab

With your application provisioned, you will have the necessary `OPENID_CLIENT_ID` and `OPENID_CLIENT_SECRET` to launch the sample application.

```sh
OpenID Client ID: 0d2ee26a-e0d6-4b91-aded-1ef0618f62c2 ## This is the OPENID_CLIENT_ID
OpenID Client Secret: dvEJSuG3Y8DYS/hcaxEKigYK25WeYCOgxCJLDH3EpH/vUI1X1hzSErDlNfLID9aP  ## This is the OPENID_CLIENT_SECRET
OpenID Host: srv.qryp.to
OpenID Port: 443
OpenID Issuer: https://srv.qryp.to/op
```

## Deploy Sample Application

Heroku is the fastest way to get the sample app running.

### Single Click Heroku Deployment

1. Deploy by clicking button below:<br/><br/>[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/Deauthorized/nodejs_openidconnect_starter_app)

2. Update `OPENID_CLIENT_ID` and `OPENID_CLIENT_SECRET` environment vars with you with those you provisioned in the Deauthorized dashboard.

### Manual Heroku Deployment

To experiment with making edits to the sample application:

1. Clone sample application locally

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Deauthorized/nodejs_openidconnect_starter_app
cd nodejs_openidconnect_starter_app
bundle install
```

2. Create Heroku Application:

```sh
heroku create --app deauthorized-nodejs-sample
git config --list | grep heroku
git push heroku master
```

3. Make your code updates in [`app/controllers/openid_controller.rb`](https://github.com/Deauthorized/nodejs_openidconnect_starter_app/blob/master/app/controllers/openid_controller.rb)

```sh
git add app/controllers/openid_controller.rb
git commit -m 'small update to sample app'
git push heroku master
heroku run rake db:migrate (if database migration needed)
heroku open
```
